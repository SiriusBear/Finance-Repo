Project used to determine if stock price of a publically traded company was over/under valued

It was found through our research and calculatoins that NRG stock was under-valued. 

Here is the summary:

Our team evaluated NRG using intrinsic and comparable models to determine whether
the company was over or undervalued, and therefore whether or not it is a good investment.
Overall, NRG is undervalued. We believe that NRG is moving towards more renewable sources
of energy and to producing a larger retail line. This conclusion was drawn because almost half of
NRGâ€™s sales are due to their retail items, and the bulk of their goodwill purchases were
renewable energy companies. NRG is likely taking out large amounts of debt in order to finance
these endeavors, we draw this conclusion because NRG is highly leveraged. In recent years NRG
has also been buying back large numbers of shares, which tells us that NRG is anticipating the
price of their stock to rise. NRG has also just now begun to pay dividends, however these
payments are erratic. Our valuations also conclude that NRG is for the most part, undervalued.
However, because our valuation shows poor payback to investors, we believe this stock is a low
risk and low return stock. We also believe that NRG is under poor management, based on the
analysis of accounting principles. Because of the current low value of return and evidence of
poor management, we would not invest in this stock.
